# hello-world
An entry into github

Mid twenties student working towards a CS degree, looking to get get into programming, but anything that pays the bills works too for right now.  Figured that in addition to picking up some new knowledge during a slow semester, I should get a start here since it seems to be a go-to place for learning and collaborating.
